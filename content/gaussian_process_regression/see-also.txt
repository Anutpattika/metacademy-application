* Some other uses for Gaussian processes in machine learning:
** classification [gaussian-process-classification]
** black-box optimization (where we only get to evaluate the function, and doing so is expensive) [bayesian-optimization-with-gaussian-processes]
** reinforcement learning [gaussian-processes-for-reinforcement-learning]
