* The smoother matrix lets us define the effective number of parameters of a regression model. [effective-num-parameters]
* It lets us define the $C_p$ statistic, a quantity used in model selection. [cp-statistic]
* The smoother matrix is conceptually related to the solutions of kenel regression algorithms:
** kernel ridge regression [kernel-ridge-regression]
** Gaussian process regression [gaussian-process-regression]
