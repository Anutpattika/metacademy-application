A vector is is a fundamental mathematical structure that is characterized by both a direction (ordering) and a magnitude. For instance, wind has both a direction (North, South-West, etc) and a magnitude (10 km/hour) and could be represented as a vector (10 km/hour South-West). A point in Euclidean space is often represented as a vector of its coordinates and is the most common type of vector encountered. More generally, a vector is an element of a vector space -- a set that is closed under scalar multiplication and vector addition.
