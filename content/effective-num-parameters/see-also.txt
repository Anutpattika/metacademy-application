* VC dimension is a more general way of determining the complexity of a model class which often coincides with the number of parameters. [vc-dimension]
* Some model selection criteria which depend on the number of parameters of a model include:
** the $C_p$ statistic [cp-statistic]
** the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [akaike-information-criterion]
** the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [bayesian-information-criterion]
